# Royal Game of Ur – Programming Twist

This project was developed in Java using Greenfoot, starting from an example code base provided by my professor. The assignment was to create our own variation of the Royal Game of Ur while incorporating elements of tangential learning.

For my version, I chose to theme the game around programming languages I was learning at the time — Java and Python. That’s why the game features a cup of coffee (Java) playing against a snake (Python).  

Below you’ll find instructions on how to play the game, along with details on the modifications I made to the original framework.



Instructions for my game "Java vs Python", based off the Royal game of UR


USER INSTRUCTIONS:

- A human player is to take on the roll of player 1 which is a coffee cup playing against a snake, Java vs Python.

- Player 1 gets the first turn. then the player rolls a die and the whatever number the die rolls on is how far a players piece is able to move. For example, you roll a 3, you are able to move a piece 3 spots over. You are able to roll up to a value of 6. 

- Then a player clicks on a moveable piece, moveable pieces will have a solid color rather than a transparent color, and once that piece is clicked on it will move however many spaces it is allowed to.

- However in the event that two players collide with one another, whether you as player one roll a number and your player piece lands on your enemies piece or vise versa, the player who caused the collision takes the spot and the player who was already on the tile looses their spot and their player piece gets sent back to the spawn area.

- Keep doing this and taking turns until all your pieces reach the end, once a piece is to reach the end it gets deleted off of the gameboard and you are now one step closer to winning the game.

- These steps keep repeating until all of one player's pieces are off the board. Whichever player has all their pieces taken off the board first wins the game, the winner will be prompted with a win message confirming their victory.
